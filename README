Minimalist app for use in speedrunning Mario 64 while live streaming to Twitch.

The goal is to have a native app that I can control using global hotkeys while
also streaming using Twitch Studio or other broadcasting software.

The app is very Mario-specific but I'm very open to contributors making it
more generic.

Mostly for me this was an opportunity to hack around with SwiftUI and try some
functional techniques for building a Swift app in that style.

Split images for Mario 64 were created by KitSovereign (https://deviantart.tumblr.com/post/26571196445/stars-by-kitsovereign)
License for these images is unconfirmed but assumed to be public domain given
that the original DeviantArt account is deactivated.

However, KitSovereign's art is sweet so follow them on Twitter and support
